In recent years the Negev region has been subjected to rapid, on-going changes including high intensity urban development and a substantial population influx. This process includes establishment of new high and low technology industrial plants, numerous start up projects, Information Technology (IT) centers, the relocation of IDF bases to the Negev and plans to develop a series of new towns alongside expanding current towns.
These changes, resulting in a fast urbanization process, require implementation of community oriented projects aiming to increasing the efforts towards reducing environmental hazards and preventing detrimental health effects in our population.
