Our goals
With the foundation of Institute, we are using our knowledge and expertise on the impact of environmental hazards on the health and wellbeing of people and ecosystems by establishing a grid of a comprehensive environmental monitoring stations platform. 
We plan to reach out to the community by developing a comprehensive program of environmental education in schools, and by the dissemination of exposure and research information to the Negev population via an accessible online website. 
We plan to create a synergistic collaboration with the policy makers, education facilities and municipalities. 
Most importantly, keeping in mind the recent major regional changes, we aim to strengthen the community awareness to the environment and facilitate creative patterns of health promotion activities via youth organizations and elderly clubs.
